                <p>Hello Everyone! Welcome back to my blog! Earlier I posted a book review on Animal Farm. To recap,  Animal Farm is a book that reflects the events during the Russian Revolution and the time under the communist rule of Joseph Stalin. The characters (animals) in the book are fleshed out from leaders/groups during that period. In the book Animal Farm, certain animals employ propaganda techniques to manipulate and control the other animals on the farm to ensure that they can rise/maintain power. After reading the book The Crooked Timber of New India Essay on a Republic in Crisis, by Parakala Prabhakar, I believe there are several actions that the leaders of the current government in India have initiated are homogenous to the efforts that the leaders in the animal farm had engaged in during the span of the story. </p>
                 <p>Demonizing the enemy: </p>
                 <p>The propaganda technique of demonizing the enemy is the act of spreading fear or creating a sense of danger among a group of people (or animals in the case of Animal Farm) to manipulate their actions and opinions. In Animal Farm, the character Napoleon (a pig who represents Joseph Stalin in the Russian Revolution) uses the method of demonizing the enemy by cultivating fear and hatred towards humans among the other animals. He does these through short yet memorable phrases such as “ Four legs good, two legs bad” or “ Farmer Jones will come back.” By creating a common enemy, he maintains power by portraying the humans as “oppressors” and “exploiters,” and thus presents himself as the savior and protector of the animals- doing so aids him in consolidating power. Napoleon also uses this hatred towards humans as a tool to avoid criticism of his actions and policies.</p>
                 <p>I believe there are certain parallels between the use of the propaganda technique of demonizing the enemy in the book Animal Farm and certain aspects of Indian Politics.</p>
                 <p>Similar to the animals in Animal Farm, the current leaders of the Indian government use religion to instigate fear among the public over certain groups or people, and in turn, create a common enemy for the masses.  According to Mr. Parakala’s book, when the current leading political party in India, the BJP came into power they emphasized the phrase “ team India,” where all people of all ages, religions, and classes should come together.  Yet, after two short years, I guess this phrase simply walked out of their vocabulary. They became apostates to the political belief they had initially endorsed.  Instead, in the PM’s ( Prime Minister’s )  2022 Independence Day address he spoke of getting rid of “our slavish mentality due to Islamic regimes,” which the PM insisted has been going on for hundreds of years. Near the end of his address, the PM states that they must fight against corruption and cleanse the nation from those who’ve enslaved us in the past. Sounds like a fictional character we know, trying to seem like the superhero while doing the villain’s deed. </p>
                 <p>Quite frankly, this is just the tip of the iceberg. An article from TIME magazine that was written a whole year before the PM’s Independence Day by  Debasish Roy Chowdhury, questions if India is heading into an anti-Muslim genocide. The article is filled with several instances of violence and hate against innocent citizens simply because their beliefs have differed from the Hindu majority, ignited by the BJP’s twisted media portrayal of “Hindu victim-hood,” hate speeches against the Muslim minority, and the “silencing of progressive voices.” This feels eerily similar to the hate speeches/slogans Napoleon used to amalgamate the animals in the book, however, a stark difference is that the animals didn’t inflict violence on their so-called enemy. I guess the BJP took the phrase actions speak louder than words too literally. </p>
                 <p>Card Stacking: </p>
                 <p>Card Stacking is a propaganda technique in which the person/group employing the method chooses/presents information that favors them, while actively excluding distorting information that may weaken or contradict their position. Presenting a skewed situation, allows the propagandist(s)to mold the audience’s opinions. In Animal Farm, this propaganda technique is utilized by the pigs to shape the other animals’ perception of reality. For example, our crucial propagandist in the tale, Squealer often highlighted the successes of the farm such as exaggerated statistics with no statistical base. Furthermore, he failed to address the other hardships, inequalities, and failures that were enveloping the farm. Instead sang exaggerated praises of Napoleon about his perfection, while turning a blind eye to his more questionable deeds.</p>
                 <p>An example of this in the book can be found in chapter 9 where Squealer sings praises of the farm. “ Reading out the figures in a shrill rapid voice,  squealer proved to them in detail that they had more oats, more hay, more turnips than they had had in Jones’s day, that they worked shorter hours, that their drinking water was of better quality, that they lived longer, that a larger proportion of their young ones survived infancy, and that they had more straw in their stalls and suffered less from fleas. Napoleon’s leadership has made our lives better.  The animals believed every word of it.</p>
                  <p>The leading political party in India is no stranger to this propaganda technique. One example outlined in Mr. Parakala’s book is when the PM took credit for bringing electricity to every village in the country. The PM was applauded for ameliorating the lives of hundreds of thousands for achieving this feat, when in reality 97% of villages already had electricity and he simply filled the 3% gap. This claim is simply one of many in an attempt to exaggerate his achievements. </p>
                  <p>The PM has an active Twitter account where most of the card stacking takes place. From exaggerating the number of incoming FDI ( Foreign Direct Investment ) by 21.8%, to even advertising that 90% of public restrooms are being regularly used while failing to address the fact that 23% don’t use the restrooms due to horrible sanitary conditions. Finally, the government flaunted that the economy rose by 13.5%, while it was because initially, the economy had plunged to great depths during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could be accredited to poor leadership. It seems that the political leaders of India are wearing tinted glasses to problems similar to the pigs in Animal Farm when addressing the nation and the farm respectively. </p>
               <p>Animal Farm is a widely known symbol that shows what happens when power is concentrated and how the fears of others can be manipulated to consolidate power in a nation. To see political powers in India initiating the same actions as the leaders in Animal Farm is worrying, as we can already predict the dire consequences. </p>

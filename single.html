								<p>Back Ground: </p>
                                                                <p>  Cursed Bunny is a collection of short stories inspired by Russian and Slavic fairy tales. Bora Chung expertly interlaces her own experiences and problems of society, to create ten unique short stories. Her stories are an unusual blend of science fiction, horror, fantasy, and supernatural. Furthermore, her visceral writing captivates readers with its blunt prose. In addition, the short stories lead readers on a thought-provoking journey to understand the unseen villains in our world: greed, hate, misogyny, and capitalism. Her book has been nominated for the International Booker Prize. </p>
								<p>Top Three Favorite Stories in the Cursed Bunny: </p>
                                                                <p>The Head: </p>
								<p>As the first story in the Cursed Bunny, “The Head’s” fast-paced and compelling storyline sets the tone for the rest of the book. The Head starts with a young woman who is constantly confronted by a creature that she calls The Head, which is described as nasty and unpleasant to the reader, and made of the woman’s bodily excretion. A mix of fear and disgust settles in the young woman as she goes about her life. Decades later, the originally disfigured Head finds the woman on a quiet night, and the woman is shocked to discover that the head has transformed into a beautiful young version of herself. Then the head traps the old woman in the toilet, and the story underscores a deep-rooted fury against the feminine perfection often expected of women, especially in Asian Societies. </p>
								<p>Cursed Bunny: </p>
								<p>The next story is called Cursed Bunny. The tale is filled with blood-thirsty revenge, against a family who controls a corporation, and shamelessly ruins any competitor through an intricate web of lies and defamation. However, karma doesn’t know how to differentiate between the rich and power, so when the narrator’s grandfather gives the current CEO’s family a lamp, the start of their demise follows. Shaped like a bunny,  it slowly destroys the family and the business they worked so hard to protect. The bunny, a symbol that represents innocence and harmlessness, relates to the mundane spaces in which the horrors of this story take place.</p> 
                                                                <p> When the lamp starts to chew through the company’s documents, it aids in creating rumors of rats in the warehouses, and wrongdoings of workers, ultimately ending in the demise of many and the dismantling of the beloved company. Cursed Bunny serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of greed and capitalism that are often prevalent in our societies today. </p>
								<p>Snare: My personal favorite, Snare, tells the story of a man who finds a fox who bleeds gold. The man impresses and then continuously hurts the fox, using the blood turned gold to go from rags to riches. The fox originally begs the man to free her from her prison, however, after the consistent violence, the fox goes silent, underscoring a larger theme of how violence can be used to silence. Eventually, the fox dies, due to the man’s greed for her blood/gold. </p>
								<p>However, the violence the man exits ceases to stop. Rather it exacerbates when the man’s abuse extends to his children. He finds out that his son can also bleed gold, but only after sucking on the blood of his daughter. This constant chain of brutality reveals the effects of modern society on human rationale, and how the attempts to escape the confines of class and gender in our modern world often end in violence and chaos. </p>
								<p>Ultimately, Bora Chung uses her supernatural, eccentric, greedy, power-hungry, helpless, and misogynistic characters and their stories to shock readers into opening their eyes to the problems we have today. Furthermore, her stories serve as a catharsis from the world we live in today because it highlights all the villains that wreak havoc in lives and minds, that society chooses to forget or hide.
                                                                  </p>

										<h2><a href="#">All Quiet On The Western Front: A Tale To Remember</a></h2>
										<p>World War I.</p>

								<p> Hello everyone, welcome back to my blog! In light of learning about World War I in my history class, I’ve decided to review Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel  All Quiet on the Western Front. The poignant novel whisks readers back to the gruesome lives of German soldiers on the frontlines during World War 1. The story is told through the eyes of a 19-year-old German soldier Paul Baumer. </p>
                                                                <p> Paul’s story begins when his schoolmaster Kantorek persuades Paul and his friends to enlist in the German army. Elated at the thought of forever glory for their nation and the appeal of the adventure, the young men sign up and are assigned to fight on the Western front. However,  Paul and his friends’ view of the war comes crashing down as they understand that they have to fight on the front lines, with little to no training. Paul vividly describes the bloody above-land battles against the French. He describes life in the trenches in detail, where soldiers on both sides were subject to inhumane living conditions,  and constant fear of the other side attacking. As Paul witnesses morbid injuries, the tragic deaths of his loved ones, and the trauma of enduring this terror, the fear and physical pain consume him, and only leave a shell of his former self. Paul detaches from the war emotionally, because he believes it’s the only way he will survive. </p>
								<p> When Paul returns home for a short period of leave, he finds himself becoming increasingly distressed. He feels as if he can’t connect with his family, as he wants to shield them from the terrible details of the war. But, he needs people to understand the emotional turmoil he is going through. Thus, he returns to the Western Front, where he faces his most traumatic experiences in the war. An enemy soldier falls into a trench with him in the no-man-land area, and Paul immediately stabs him in self-defense. This is Paul’s first experience of hand-to-hand combat in the war.  Paul immediately drowns in guilt, however, learning the soldier is not dead, Paul bandages his wounds and gives him water. </p>
								<p> The two talk and Paul realizes they have more in common than the politicians who are having them fight in the war. This moment is a turning point for Paul, as he realizes how the war snatched away his compassion. However, the soldier dies, and Paul’s survival instincts overtake his compassion again, and he tries to escape the trench. Paul almost survives the entire war, passing away only a month before its end on a surprisingly calm day, in which there was no fighting. His quiet death serves as a contrast to the bloody and gruesome war he was a part of, and symbolizes death as the only way out of the violence. </p>
								<p> All quiet on the Western Front is a testament, that war is nothing more than a rampage of useless slaughter, robbing a generation's right to live and love life. In addition, it serves as a powerful reminder that one can physically escape from war, but never mentally, the fear and trauma will always be seared into the minds of those who’ve been through it. This book was written in 1928 to depict conflict then, but almost a century later innocent lives are still being scarred and destroyed, just with better warfare. </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Lessons Learned from Animal Farm: A high schooler’s perspective</a></h2>
										<p>Article on "Animal Farm" from my Perspectiv</p>
									</div>

										<time class="published" datetime="2023-12-20">December 20, 2023</time>

								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/AnimalFarm.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%; height:auto; /></span>
								<p> Hello Everyone! Welcome back to my blog! Earlier I posted a book review on Animal Farm. To recap,  Animal Farm is a book that reflects the events during the Russian Revolution and the time under the communist rule of Joseph Stalin. The characters (animals) in the book are fleshed out from leaders/groups during that period. In the book Animal Farm, certain animals employ propaganda techniques to manipulate and control the other animals on the farm to ensure that they can rise/maintain power. After reading the book The Crooked Timber of New India Essay on a Republic in Crisis, by Parakala Prabhakar, I believe there are several actions that the leaders of the current government in India have initiated are homogenous to the efforts that the leaders in the animal farm had engaged in during the span of the story. </p>
                                                                <p>Demonizing the enemy: </p>
								<p>The propaganda technique of demonizing the enemy is the act of spreading fear or creating a sense of danger among a group of people (or animals in the case of Animal Farm) to manipulate their actions and opinions. In Animal Farm, the character Napoleon (a pig who represents Joseph Stalin in the Russian Revolution) uses the method of demonizing the enemy by cultivating fear and hatred towards humans among the other animals. He does these through short yet memorable phrases such as “ Four legs good, two legs bad” or “ Farmer Jones will come back.” By creating a common enemy, he maintains power by portraying the humans as “oppressors” and “exploiters,” and thus presents himself as the savior and protector of the animals- doing so aids him in consolidating power. Napoleon also uses this hatred towards humans as a tool to avoid criticism of his actions and policies.</p>
								<p>I believe there are certain parallels between the use of the propaganda technique of demonizing the enemy in the book Animal Farm and certain aspects of Indian Politics. </p>
								<p>Similar to the animals in Animal Farm, the current leaders of the Indian government use religion to instigate fear among the public over certain groups or people, and in turn, create a common enemy for the masses.  According to Mr. Parakala’s book, when the current leading political party in India, the BJP came into power they emphasized the phrase “ team India,” where all people of all ages, religions, and classes should come together.  Yet, after two short years, I guess this phrase simply walked out of their vocabulary. They became apostates to the political belief they had initially endorsed.  Instead, in the PM’s ( Prime Minister’s )  2022 Independence Day address he spoke of getting rid of “our slavish mentality due to Islamic regimes,” which the PM insisted has been going on for hundreds of years. Near the end of his address, the PM states that they must fight against corruption and cleanse the nation from those who’ve enslaved us in the past. Sounds like a fictional character we know, trying to seem like the superhero while doing the villain’s deed. </p>
								<p>Quite frankly, this is just the tip of the iceberg. An article from TIME magazine that was written a whole year before the PM’s Independence Day by  Debasish Roy Chowdhury, questions if India is heading into an anti-Muslim genocide. The article is filled with several instances of violence and hate against innocent citizens simply because their beliefs have differed from the Hindu majority, ignited by the BJP’s twisted media portrayal of “Hindu victim-hood,” hate speeches against the Muslim minority, and the “silencing of progressive voices.” This feels eerily similar to the hate speeches/slogans Napoleon used to amalgamate the animals in the book, however, a stark difference is that the animals didn’t inflict violence on their so-called enemy. I guess the BJP took the phrase actions speak louder than words too literally. </p>
								<p>Card Stacking: </p>
								<p>Card Stacking is a propaganda technique in which the person/group employing the method chooses/presents information that favors them, while actively excluding distorting information that may weaken or contradict their position. Presenting a skewed situation, allows the propagandist(s)to mold the audience’s opinions. In Animal Farm, this propaganda technique is utilized by the pigs to shape the other animals’ perception of reality. For example, our crucial propagandist in the tale, Squealer often highlighted the successes of the farm such as exaggerated statistics with no statistical base. Furthermore, he failed to address the other hardships, inequalities, and failures that were enveloping the farm. Instead sang exaggerated praises of Napoleon about his perfection, while turning a blind eye to his more questionable deeds.</p>	
								<p>An example of this in the book can be found in chapter 9 where Squealer sings praises of the farm. “ Reading out the figures in a shrill rapid voice,  squealer proved to them in detail that they had more oats, more hay, more turnips than they had had in Jones’s day, that they worked shorter hours, that their drinking water was of better quality, that they lived longer, that a larger proportion of their young ones survived infancy, and that they had more straw in their stalls and suffered less from fleas. Napoleon’s leadership has made our lives better.  The animals believed every word of it.</p>	
								<p>The leading political party in India is no stranger to this propaganda technique. One example outlined in Mr. Parakala’s book is when the PM took credit for bringing electricity to every village in the country. The PM was applauded for ameliorating the lives of hundreds of thousands for achieving this feat, when in reality 97% of villages already had electricity and he simply filled the 3% gap. This claim is simply one of many in an attempt to exaggerate his achievements. </p>	
								<p>The PM has an active Twitter account where most of the card stacking takes place. From exaggerating the number of incoming FDI ( Foreign Direct Investment ) by 21.8%, to even advertising that 90% of public restrooms are being regularly used while failing to address the fact that 23% don’t use the restrooms due to horrible sanitary conditions. Finally, the government flaunted that the economy rose by 13.5%, while it was because initially, the economy had plunged to great depths during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could be accredited to poor leadership. It seems that the political leaders of India are wearing tinted glasses to problems similar to the pigs in Animal Farm when addressing the nation and the farm respectively. </p>	
								<p>Animal Farm is a widely known symbol that shows what happens when power is concentrated and how the fears of others can be manipulated to consolidate power in a nation. To see political powers in India initiating the same actions as the leaders in Animal Farm is worrying, as we can already predict the dire consequences. </p>

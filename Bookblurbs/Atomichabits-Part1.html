                <p>Hello! Welcome back to my blog! I will start a new series called The Blurbs of Big Books. Do you ever want to read informational books that can improve your lifestyle, or just make you feel smart when you converse about them? The problem you might face is you find yourself too busy with work, school, or just life in general. This is why the Blurb of Big Books series is perfect for you. Although there may be hundreds of book summaries for a book, The Blurbs of Big Books is different! I won’t be summarizing an entire book in one post, instead, I will try to analyze chapters or a couple of important points in chapters.</p>
                <p>First up in this series is Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results by James Clear. I am someone who is more accustomed to reading books online via kindle,  due to the rarity of finding English book stores in Korea. However, during my trip to India, I had long layovers/wait times in different countries. During that period I found an abundance of book stores located in different nooks of the airport. Now, at all of these stores, I skipped the non-fiction section immediately and dived into the mystery and thrillers section. However, on every occasion I entered a book store, there was just this one book being displayed constantly.  It caught my attention and I decided to read it. Now this book is almost perfect for people like me who find it hard to maintain habits. Even going into writing this series I was overthinking as to if I would actually continue this and maintain reading and writing about this book,  as a habit. I guess the first chapter of this book convinced me to go ahead with this. </p>
                <p>WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A DIFFERENCE?</p>
                <p>This chapter is interesting as it directly contradicts the statement of bigger is better. Directly quoting from the book “ “Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action.” I believe this couldn’t be truer. When we decide to do something as simple as losing weight, we often think of big goals immediately, such as losing 10kg. However, the habits that will help us reach that goal is often an afterthought. However, Mr. Clear makes it clear that even progressing 1% every day is the key to success. Although “improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even noticeable” he states that it will be a “ minor setback that will accumulate into something more.” The book further explains how habits are “ compound interests of self-improvement.” We’ve all probably heard about compound interest in math class ( maybe not if you slept through it). However, just as compound interest multiples money, Mr. Clear suggests that small habits will multiply as long as you repeat them. </p>
                <p>The concept of doing a little every day is a “difficult concept” for most of us. According to the book, humans often want our habits to produce changes in an unrealistic time frame. In the meanwhile, humans are quite proactive in terms of bad habits, as the consequences show up in due time. An example of this from the book is when Mr. Clear mentions how “If you procrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later.”
However, while we repeat 1 percent errors it will create an “ accumulation of many missteps.” Often we think of success as something that should be obtained as soon as possible, however, Mr. Clear takes a different approach to this. He states that “it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success.” Who knew habits had that much power? </p>
                <p>WHAT PROGRESS IS REALLY LIKE?</p>
                <p>Progress is a fickle term in my opinion and people tend to think about it in different ways. According to Mr. Clear, it’s a culmination of “breakthrough moments often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change” He also explains how human nature often expects progress to be measured in a linear trend, however,       “ the most powerful outcomes are delayed.” To prove this point The San Antonio Spurs, one of the most successful teams in NBA history, has a quote from social reformer Jacob Riis hanging in their locker room: “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow, it will split in two,” Which really does show the power of patience in progress. </p>

 <p> Welcome back to Big Book Blurbs! Today’s chapter has an interesting title. It’s called The Man Who Didn’t Look Right. This chapter is filled with anecdotes that Mr. Clear has heard before. Well, let’s jump into it!</p>
 <p>The first anecdote talks about a woman saying she doesn’t like the way her father-in-law looks. Thinking of it as a joke, the father-in-law also stated that he doesn’t like her looks either. She further explained that he didn’t look right in terms of his condition. They went to the hospital for a medical examination, and it turned out that he needed to go into emergency surgery due to the blockage of an artery. Now the catch was that the man felt perfectly fine all day long, however,  the daughter-in-law could predict that something was because she was a pandemic. She had often seen a change in patients' blood distribution during her job, thus she was able to tell that something was wrong with her father-in-law. This anecdote shows that with enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. We can’t always explain what we are learning, but learning is happening all along the way, and your ability to notice relevant cues in a situation is the foundation of every habit you have. To think about it simply, you do not tell your heart to pump or your lungs to breathe. It happens subconsciously. This is the same thing as a habit. You don’t need to be aware of a cue or habit, to begin with. You can perform a habit without consciously paying attention to it.  </p>
 <p> The next chapter is called The Best Way to Start a Habit. When you form a habit your actions come in the direction of " your automatic and unconscious mind.” The more you repeat habits the less likely you are to question what you are doing and why you’re doing it. There is a process called pointing and calling. This is a safety system that is designed to reduce mistakes. Although it may seem silly it has some very effective qualities. Pointing and calling raise habits to a more conscious level. Scientifically it’s shown that the point and calling method helps raise the effectiveness of a habit by almost 57%, due to the increased amount of conscious level. Now, this is a tool to build habits and sustain them until we can do them unconsciously.</p>
 <p>The Habit Score Card is also another effective method that helps us track our habits and help us reach them in a long-term plan. The first step is to write a list of habits you would like to achieve such as Waking up at 5 A.M, Doing some Cardio,  and eating a healthy diet for lunch, which are examples of this. Now go about your day and write a + if you did the habit, - if you didn’t, and equal if you did it partially. Now there is no need to change anything at first. The goal is to simply notice what is going on. Observe your thoughts and actions without judgment or internal criticism. Don’t blame yourself for your faults. Don’t praise yourself for your successes. The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.</p>
 <p>I hope you learned something new about habits, how they work, and how to start one in this big book blurbs post. </p>

                <p> Hello everyone, welcome back to my blog! In light of learning about World War I in my history class, I’ve decided to review Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel  All Quiet on the Western Front. The poignant novel whisks readers back to the gruesome lives of German soldiers on the frontlines during World War 1. The story is told through the eyes of a 19-year-old German soldier Paul Baumer. </p>
                <p> Paul’s story begins when his schoolmaster Kantorek persuades Paul and his friends to enlist in the German army. Elated at the thought of forever glory for their nation and the appeal of the adventure, the young men sign up and are assigned to fight on the Western front. However,  Paul and his friends’ view of the war comes crashing down as they understand that they have to fight on the front lines, with little to no training. Paul vividly describes the bloody above-land battles against the French. He describes life in the trenches in detail, where soldiers on both sides were subject to inhumane living conditions,  and constant fear of the other side attacking. As Paul witnesses morbid injuries, the tragic deaths of his loved ones, and the trauma of enduring this terror, the fear and physical pain consume him, and only leave a shell of his former self. Paul detaches from the war emotionally, because he believes it’s the only way he will survive. </p>
                <p> When Paul returns home for a short period of leave, he finds himself becoming increasingly distressed. He feels as if he can’t connect with his family, as he wants to shield them from the terrible details of the war. But, he needs people to understand the emotional turmoil he is going through. Thus, he returns to the Western Front, where he faces his most traumatic experiences in the war. An enemy soldier falls into a trench with him in the no-man-land area, and Paul immediately stabs him in self-defense. This is Paul’s first experience of hand-to-hand combat in the war.  Paul immediately drowns in guilt, however, learning the soldier is not dead, Paul bandages his wounds and gives him water. </p>
                <p> The two talk and Paul realizes they have more in common than the politicians who are having them fight in the war. This moment is a turning point for Paul, as he realizes how the war snatched away his compassion. However, the soldier dies, and Paul’s survival instincts overtake his compassion again, and he tries to escape the trench. Paul almost survives the entire war, passing away only a month before its end on a surprisingly calm day, in which there was no fighting. His quiet death serves as a contrast to the bloody and gruesome war he was a part of, and symbolizes death as the only way out of the violence. </p>
                <p> All quiet on the Western Front is a testament, that war is nothing more than a rampage of useless slaughter, robbing a generation's right to live and love life. In addition, it serves as a powerful reminder that one can physically escape from war, but never mentally, the fear and trauma will always be seared into the minds of those who’ve been through it. This book was written in 1928 to depict conflict then, but almost a century later innocent lives are still being scarred and destroyed, just with better warfare. </p>

                <p>India. Once hailed for being one of the biggest democracies in the world since the 1950s, to now hiding behind a curtain to avoid the world's scrutiny. As India grapples with the consequences associated with Hindu nationalism, the muffled sounds of oppressed voices and an extensive list of issues are taking a toll on the nation. The whole world looks at India wondering if the nation will hold on to its democratic roots or if the weeds of authoritarianism will grow to suffocate the last semblance of democracy left in the nation.  </p>
               <p> How is Hindu Nationalism Leading to a Decline in Democracy in India?</p>
               <p>The basis for India’s democracy, the constitution, emphasizes that regardless of faith, Indians should be treated as equal citizens. However, ever since the rise of the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), critics have been wondering if Hindu nationalism, the idea that the Hindu faith and culture should shape the state and its politics, is dominating the political climate of India. The 2022 annual report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) stated, “The government continued to systemize its ideological vision of a Hindu state at both the national and state levels through the use of both existing and new laws and structural changes hostile to the country’s religious minorities." </p>
               <p> A notable example is when the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was passed on December 11th, 2019. The act was passed due to its ability to expedite citizenship for refugees from neighboring countries. However, the CAA is only applicable to those who identify as non-Muslims, thus the BJP is actively violating equal citizenship rights outlined in the constitution in favor of their Hindu Nationalist Vision.</p>
               <p> Later in 2021, the government enacted the Freedom of Religion Act. The act’s purpose was to punish those who might convince people to convert to different religions through force, fraud, or allurement. However, the Act also includes a clause in which the government must approve if a citizen would like to convert to a religion other than Hinduism. The government’s blatant disregard for constitutional rights which emphasize religious freedom in favor of their Hindu nationalist vision adds to the concern of the decline of democracy in India. </p>
               <p> How is the Media Being Silenced in India?</p>
               <p>India’s democracy relies on four pillars: the judiciary branch, the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the media. Indian democracy relies on all the pillars being upheld. The media plays an especially pivotal role in ensuring the democracy of a nation, as it allows citizens to make informed decisions and those in power are held accountable for their actions. However, with India ranking 161st out of 180 nations in the 2023 Press Freedom Index, critics are raising red flags about media oppression in India. One of the main reasons for media oppression is that the government is actively assigning government officials as “fact-checkers” for news and information for news outlets. This was to ensure any news that would criticize the government negatively would be withheld from the public </p>
               <p> 	In addition, the government oppresses the voices of the media through the use of laws such as the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and the Sedition Act. Critics say these acts are extremely “broad” and “vague” and are used to charge journalists with crimes such as “anti-national activities” and "sedition" as a way to silence those speaking out against the government. In addition, the government uses tax raids, police searches, and threats of violence to create a climate of fear among journalists. The government's crackdown on the media has led to the silence of thousands of progressive voices and the fall of democracy as the nation’s government is no longer held accountable for its actions.</p>
               <p> Is India Turning to Authoritarianism?</p>
               <p> In 2023, Freedom House, an organization that advocates for political freedom, published a report called Freedom in the World 2023 Country Report, which categorized India as a “flawed democracy,” leading many to wonder if the rising Hindu-nationalist agenda of the BJP and the silencing of voices in India are causing India to free-fall into authoritarianism. While the current policies and actions the current government engages in lean towards authoritarianism, there is a distinct possibility that democracy will rise again in India as numerous political parties are looking to overthrow the BJP in favor of a more democratic nation. The 2024 general elections from April to May will be crucial for the future of India, as they will set the stage to see if democracy or authoritarianism </p>

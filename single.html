								<p>Back Ground: </p>
                                                                <p>  Cursed Bunny is a collection of short stories inspired by Russian and Slavic fairy tales. Bora Chung expertly interlaces her own experiences and problems of society, to create ten unique short stories. Her stories are an unusual blend of science fiction, horror, fantasy, and supernatural. Furthermore, her visceral writing captivates readers with its blunt prose. In addition, the short stories lead readers on a thought-provoking journey to understand the unseen villains in our world: greed, hate, misogyny, and capitalism. Her book has been nominated for the International Booker Prize. </p>
								<p>Top Three Favorite Stories in the Cursed Bunny: </p>
                                                                <p>The Head: </p>
								<p>As the first story in the Cursed Bunny, “The Head’s” fast-paced and compelling storyline sets the tone for the rest of the book. The Head starts with a young woman who is constantly confronted by a creature that she calls The Head, which is described as nasty and unpleasant to the reader, and made of the woman’s bodily excretion. A mix of fear and disgust settles in the young woman as she goes about her life. Decades later, the originally disfigured Head finds the woman on a quiet night, and the woman is shocked to discover that the head has transformed into a beautiful young version of herself. Then the head traps the old woman in the toilet, and the story underscores a deep-rooted fury against the feminine perfection often expected of women, especially in Asian Societies. </p>
								<p>Cursed Bunny: </p>
								<p>The next story is called Cursed Bunny. The tale is filled with blood-thirsty revenge, against a family who controls a corporation, and shamelessly ruins any competitor through an intricate web of lies and defamation. However, karma doesn’t know how to differentiate between the rich and power, so when the narrator’s grandfather gives the current CEO’s family a lamp, the start of their demise follows. Shaped like a bunny,  it slowly destroys the family and the business they worked so hard to protect. The bunny, a symbol that represents innocence and harmlessness, relates to the mundane spaces in which the horrors of this story take place.</p> 
                                                                <p> When the lamp starts to chew through the company’s documents, it aids in creating rumors of rats in the warehouses, and wrongdoings of workers, ultimately ending in the demise of many and the dismantling of the beloved company. Cursed Bunny serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of greed and capitalism that are often prevalent in our societies today. </p>
								<p>Snare: My personal favorite, Snare, tells the story of a man who finds a fox who bleeds gold. The man impresses and then continuously hurts the fox, using the blood turned gold to go from rags to riches. The fox originally begs the man to free her from her prison, however, after the consistent violence, the fox goes silent, underscoring a larger theme of how violence can be used to silence. Eventually, the fox dies, due to the man’s greed for her blood/gold. </p>
								<p>However, the violence the man exits ceases to stop. Rather it exacerbates when the man’s abuse extends to his children. He finds out that his son can also bleed gold, but only after sucking on the blood of his daughter. This constant chain of brutality reveals the effects of modern society on human rationale, and how the attempts to escape the confines of class and gender in our modern world often end in violence and chaos. </p>
								<p>Ultimately, Bora Chung uses her supernatural, eccentric, greedy, power-hungry, helpless, and misogynistic characters and their stories to shock readers into opening their eyes to the problems we have today. Furthermore, her stories serve as a catharsis from the world we live in today because it highlights all the villains that wreak havoc in lives and minds, that society chooses to forget or hide.
                                                                  </p>

                <p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to my blog! In today’s post, I’m going to be reviewing a book I read in the last semester of my English class called Animal Farm. It is a satirical/allegorical novel written by the internationally acclaimed author George Orwell. The book was published in 1945 as an allegory to the Russian Revolution. I hope you enjoy this post!</p>
                <p>The story starts on the Manor Farm, where all the animals live under the oppressive rule of humans, Mr. and Mrs. Jones. The animals are severely underfed, horribly overworked, and abused. However, the human couple lived comfortably. One night, the animals came together for a speech by an elderly boar named Old Major. Our revolutionist delivers a rousing speech about a utopian world, where all the animals unite to drive the humans out of Manor Farm, which will allow the animals to rule themselves without a tyrannical leader. Old Major calls this new idea Animalism. In addition, Old Major proposes the idea of having “temporary leaders” who will help the animals get used to the utopia and then will step down after animalism is implemented. The rebellion against the humans soon ensues, and the animals come out with a victory, changing the Manor Farm into Animal Farm.</p>
                <p>Just as the animals are relishing their new-found freedom, two pigs on the farm quickly assume leadership roles, Napoleon and Snowball. Together the two create commandments that all animals must follow, and slogans to supposedly unite the animals such as “All animals are equal,” and “Four legs good two legs bad.” The two pigs soon have an iron grip on the happenings on the farm, while using their intelligence as a justification for their control. All the animals have different views towards Animalism. Some animals such as the horses, work their hardest and push their limits for the new leaders. Meanwhile, others do what’s expected of them, not any more or any less. The final group of animals is far too vain to succumb to their new leaders’ orders. However, somehow the farm continues to run, and the animals are relatively happy.</p>
                <p>Over time, the two leaders start to clash over matters of the farm, but the power struggle ends when Napoleon utilizes propaganda to chase Snowball out of the farm. Meanwhile, Napoleon controls his bounty of mindless followers through the manipulation of language. Whenever controversy sparks over his new policies, he has his faithful sheep to bleat out propagandist slogans until the other animals forget what they were arguing about. He has his propagandists spew exaggerated facts about the farm affairs and sing praises about himself. Napoleon and the other pigs eventually betray and tarnish the initial principles of Animalism. They begin to rewrite the commandments that outline the original principles to justify their increasing privileges and mistreatment of other animals. The pigs begin to live a lavish lifestyle, while leaving the other animals to do the dirty work, leaving them in the pretense that their sacrifices are for the greater good of the farm.</p>
                <p>They also manipulate and deceive the other animals using propaganda and use intimidation to maintain control. The animals begin to live under a regime that mirrors the human they initially sought to escape. The animals eventually witness the pigs' cooperation with humans and tyrannical behavior. The pigs also changed their slogan from all animals are equal to all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others. Finally, they changed the farm's name back to "Manor Farm," wiping out any evidence of the revolution.</p>
                <p>Animal Farm is a blaring example of dictatorship and a cautionary tale about the misuse of authority. It clearly shows the corruption that is followed when power is centralized. In addition, how quickly new oppressors may misuse revolutions for their benefit. Readers are reminded of the need of vigilance and the need to question authority through Orwell's terrifying depiction of the consequences when idealism is distorted.</p>

                <p>Welcome back to Big Book Blurbs! Today I am going to be continuing the series with Part TWo of Atomic Habits. Today’s chapter is called How Your Habits Shape Your Identity ( and Vice Versa). Well, let’s get into it! I hope you like this post!</p>
                <p>To begin with, Mr. Clear asks the question of why it’s so easy to repeat bad habits and hard to form good ones. The answer he gives us is that habits that are normally classified as good like exercising, meditation, and journaling are reasonable for a day or two and then become a hassle. However, when they are established he states that they will stick around forever. He states that there are 3 layers to achieving a behavioral change. The first step is to change your outcomes. The second is changing your processes, something simple such as decluttering your desk for better work productivity. The third process is the deepest layer in changing your identity.  Most people focus on what they would like to achieve, however, to form habits that will last, we must focus on who we wish to become. The process we would like to follow is an imperative part of this. Most people never consider an identity change, they simply set out to think of the outcome they wish to achieve. Most people don’t realize that their old identity can sabotage their plans for change. </p>
                <p>“Behavior is incongruent with the self will not last,” this is an essential phrase as it supplements the myriad of examples as to why habits don’t work out. An example is if you want more money however, your personality is someone who consumes more money than you create. The best form of habit is when the habit becomes a part of your identity. It has to be something you are extremely proud of, if you are proud of your money then you will work harder to save it and use it wisely. Some more examples of this that are provided by Mr. Clear is if you want to read more then your goal is not to read a book, but the goal is to become a reader. If your goal is to run a marathon, then the goal is to become a runner. Infuse your habits and goals with your identity, and there is a high chance that you will succeed. Although it may be corny to say this, you just need to be yourself! Building habits is just a 2 step process according to Mr. Clear. Decide the type of person you would like to be. Prove it to yourself by setting and achieving small goals. </p>
                <p>The next chapter is about how to build better habits in 4 simple steps. A habit is a behavior. If it’s repeated enough times it becomes automatic. Whenever you face a problem your brain begins a series of automated solutions to the issue. Thus, your brain doles out different or similar responses. With practice, the useless movements “fade away.” As habits are created the level of activity in the brain. When a similar situation occurs in the future your brain no longer feels the need to analyze each step. This is the scientific method of how a habit is formed. It’s interesting to see something as simple as a habit have so many layers of creation. Although this chapter is called how to build better habits, the actual in-depth steps to do so are in the next chapter. However, Mr. Clear does give a small clue about the steps in the chapter summary. He writes that “habits can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: Cue, Craving, Response, and Reward. </p>
                <p>I hope this post provides information and is helpful as to how to further create and maintain habits. I hope to see you in the next post. </p>
